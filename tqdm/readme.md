##ðŸŽ¯ Purpose of the file_processor.py 

The primary purpose of this Python script is to demonstrate the practical application of the tqdm library by simulating a long-running batch process. It is a focused mini-project designed for monitoring code execution.

### Key Objectives:
Illustrate tqdm: Show how to easily wrap any iterable (file_list) with tqdm() to create a live, informative progress bar.

Code: for file_name in tqdm(file_list, desc="Processing Files")

Simulate Workload: Create a realistic scenario where each task takes a variable amount of time, allowing tqdm to dynamically calculate the speed and estimated time remaining (ETA).

Code: time.sleep(random.uniform(0.05, 0.2))

Monitor Batch Processing: Mimic the common pattern in data science (like in Kaggle or deep learning) where a large number of items (files, batches, or records) must be processed sequentially.

Control Input: Use the num_files parameter (set to 30) as a clear control input to define the size of the simulated workload, making the script easy to test and scale.

In short, the code provides a clear, visual template for adding performance monitoring to any Python script involving long-running loops.
